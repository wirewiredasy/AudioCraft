### Audio Processing
- **Core Libraries**: Librosa for advanced audio analysis, Pydub for manipulation
- **Processing Methods**: 
  - Vocal removal using center channel extraction + spectral subtraction
  - Pitch/tempo adjustment with independent control
  - Format conversion with quality options
  - Noise reduction using spectral subtraction
  - Volume normalization with RMS analysis
- **File Support**: MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, M4A, WMA
- **Quality Control**: Professional normalization and anti-clipping

### Data Layer
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with organized upload/processed directories
- **Temporary Files**: Automatic cleanup system
- **File Management**: UUID-based naming for security
- **Download System**: Static file serving through FastAPI

## Development Workflow

1. **Backend**: Runs on `http://localhost:8000` with API documentation at `/docs`
2. **Frontend**: Runs on `http://localhost:3000` with hot reload
3. **File Processing**: Upload â†’ Process â†’ Download workflow
4. **API Communication**: Frontend calls backend endpoints with FormData

## Deployment

- Docker Compose setup for both services
- Production-ready with Nginx reverse proxy
- Environment variable configuration
- Health checks and restart policies
