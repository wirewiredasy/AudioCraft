# ODOREMOVER Audio Suite - Project Documentation

## Overview

This is the complete ODOREMOVER Audio Suite - a professional full-stack audio processing platform built with React + Next.js frontend and FastAPI microservices backend architecture. The project provides advanced tools for audio manipulation including vocal removal, pitch/tempo adjustment, format conversion, noise reduction, and more.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Custom UI Requirements: 
- Custom static icons/logos for each tool (not lucide icons)
- Unique complex logo for "ODOREMOVER" webapp brand
- Mobile responsive with separate desktop/mobile layouts
- Authentication system with dashboard functionality
- Language support system implementation
- Professional unique UI organization

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: React + Next.js 14 with TypeScript support
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with custom glassmorphism design system
- **Component Structure**: Modular components in `/components` directory
- **Routing**: Next.js file-based routing with dynamic tool pages
- **State Management**: Local React state with context API
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API communication

### Backend Architecture
- **Server Framework**: FastAPI with async/await support
- **Architecture Pattern**: Microservices with API Gateway
- **API Gateway**: Central routing hub at `backend/api_gateway/main.py`
- **Microservices**: Each tool runs as separate service in `backend/services/`
- **Request Processing**: FastAPI multipart form handling
- **Error Handling**: HTTP exception handling with detailed responses

### Audio Processing
- **Core Libraries**: Librosa for advanced audio analysis, Pydub for manipulation
- **Processing Methods**: 
  - Vocal removal using center channel extraction + spectral subtraction
  - Pitch/tempo adjustment with independent control
  - Format conversion with quality options
  - Noise reduction using spectral subtraction
  - Volume normalization with RMS analysis
- **File Support**: MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, M4A, WMA
- **Quality Control**: Professional normalization and anti-clipping

### Data Layer
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with organized upload/processed directories
- **Temporary Files**: Automatic cleanup system
- **File Management**: UUID-based naming for security
- **Download System**: Static file serving through FastAPI
